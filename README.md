# Forge-in-Kotlin
Small console project for uni to practise Kotlin functionalities

What can you do in the forge?
You have some options:
1. Forge new weapon
2. Destroy one of your weapons
3. Use one of your weapons (there is usage and endurance parameter in each weapon)
4. Show stats from one of your weapons
5. Show your inventory
6. Exit program :)

Each wepons contains:
1. Name,
2. Short description,
3. Endurance (how many times you can still use this weapon)
4. Usage (how many times this weapon was used)
5. Rarity

And each type of weapon (currently there are 4 - Swords, Shields, Axes and Maces) has its own special parameters e.g. Swords have sharpness parameter

Your inventory is constantly updated unless you want to possess more than 5 weapons. Moreover you can't have two identical weapons!
Or you just wish to exit the program, then your inventory will be destroyed ðŸ˜¨
